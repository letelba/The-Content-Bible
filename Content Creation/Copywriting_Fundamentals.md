# How to grab Attention

- Challange their beliefs (Squats are terrible for quad development)
- Ask a 2 option question (What's a better goal? 100k, or 10k?)
- Be relatable (Have you ever tried making $ online but didn't know where to start and kept runnning into scams?)
- Ask a paradoxical question. (Why is the average millionaire is less educated than average?)
- Strong promise. (Here is how to get hired by Netflix and make $24/hr from home with no experience)

# How to hold their attention with intrigue

We do this by making open loops in order to use our readers curiosity as fuel. 

Think of intrigue as an itch. You tell the reader you have something they want, but they will have to wait in oder to get it. 

"Squats are terrible for quad development, here's why..."

You don't want to open and close the loop right away, so you can hold their attention, while you don't close the loop. 

You close the loop, opening a new one. 

# The duality of decisions

Logic vs Emotion

People buy with emotion, but they rationalize with logic. 

Action is when Emotion and logic aligned. 


# How to satisfy the emotional side of the brain?

## StoryTelling.
All humans are easily hooked in by a good story. It's one of the best ways to grab attention.

## Paiting a Picture.
When you describe things in your copy, you should always paint a vivid picture by using ultra specificity. 

## Highlighting benefits over Features. 
A feature is something like a a16 bionic phone chip. The benefit is that you can now surf the web or play games on your phone smoother than ever before. 

## Describe Fear and Dream States. 
These are highly emotional triggers that paint a drastic change, either good or bad in people's minds. 

## Use urgency and Scarcity.
The fear of missing out is easily one of the most useful emotional triggers. Humans won't take action unless there's a reason to do it right now. 

# Satisfying the logical part of the brain

## Borrowed Authority
Getting People to trust in what you are saying isn't always easy, which is why you can get them to believe you if what you're saying aligns with someone they do trust. 

## Relatability. 
When you describe someone's situation better than they can they'll naturally believe you have the solution. 

## Statistics.
It's difficult to argue with facts and figures. Statistics can also be combined with borrwed authority for massive persuasion. 

## Testimonials.
if there's someone else who can relate to the reader that has gotten the results the reader wants it does wonders for building trust. People will trust you if others trust you. 

## Proven Scarcity. 
If you can't come up with a genuine reason why scarcity exists, then you have no reason to use it. Pro tip: Scarcity can ALWAYS be created. 

## Analogies. 
Building off of proven concepts and things that people already know is great way to convice them of you point.
